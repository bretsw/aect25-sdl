### Abstract

The game development industry, like many technology sectors, is rapidly evolving due to employment trends, market shifts, and technological advancements. Game developers must continuously learn and update skills to stay competitive. This study explores how developers engage in self-directed learning (SDL) to adapt and grow. Qualitative interview data provide new insights into SDL theory, including motivations (external and internal), strategies for overcoming challenges, and key supports.
