# `r fa("far fa-compass", fill = "#fff")` A Volatile Industry

```{r, out.width = "600px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}

Changes in the video game industry:

--

- Repeating rounds of layoffs

--

- Shifting market interest to genres like dating simulators and role-playing games (RPGs)

--

- Emerging technologies (AR, VR, AI)

---

# `r fa("far fa-compass", fill = "#fff")` Workplace Learning

```{r, out.width = "680px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/bored-dev.png")
```

--

Corporate training and mandated professional development can't keep up

--

and struggles to engage learners

--

`r fa("fas fa-arrow-right", fill = "#782F40")` 80% of workplace learning is informal (Yeo, 2008)
